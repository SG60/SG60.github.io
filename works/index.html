<p><em>for countertenor, alto flute, bass clarinet, Bb trumpet, tenor trombone, percussion, piano, and double bass - approx. 12 minutes</em></p>
<h4 id="in-memoriam-easter-1915">In Memoriam (Easter, 1915)</h4>
<p>The flowers left thick at nightfall in the wood<br>
This Eastertide call into mind the men,<br>
Now far from home, who, with their sweethearts, should<br>
Have gathered them and will do never again.</p>
<h4 id="the-combe">The Combe</h4>
<p>The Combe was ever dark, ancient and dark.<br>
Its mouth is stopped with bramble, thorn, and briar;<br>
And no one scrambles over the sliding chalk<br>
By beech and yew and perishing juniper<br>
Down the half precipices of its sides, with roots<br>
And rabbit holes for steps. The sun of Winter,<br>
The moon of Summer, and all the singing birds<br>
Except the missel-thrush that loves juniper,<br>
Are quite shut out. But far more ancient and dark<br>
The Combe looks since they killed the badger there,<br>
Dug him out and gave him to the hounds,<br>
That most ancient Briton of English beasts.</p>
<h4 id="programme-note-for-the-combe">Programme Note for &lsquo;The Combe&rsquo;</h4>
<p>I grew up close to Edward Thomas&rsquo;s home in East Hampshire, and I hope that landscape has filtered into this composition. The wooded hangers above Steep are a very distinctive landscape of predominantly beech slopes with dark yew valleys. One of these mysterious and ancient yew woods sits below the house Thomas lived in from 1909 until 1913, and may be the very combe which the poem refers to.</p>
<p>This setting uses the unsettling sound of a dark and low ensemble combined with a countertenor voice to reflect the uneasy tone of the poem. The poem is divided into two equal halves. These are divided by a central instrumental section and preceded by a slowly building introduction.</p>
<p>The reprised &ldquo;juniper&rdquo; motif ties the two halves of the poem together. They are almost all now gone from the hangers.</p>

<h3 id="spin-2020">Spin (2020)</h3>
<p><em>for piano trio - approx. 10 minutes</em></p>
<p><em>Spin</em> centres on just two core cyclic patterns, which organically interact and &ldquo;spin&rdquo; around each other over the course of this twelve-minute, singlemovement, work. The piano is oen treated separately from the violin and violoncello, with seemingly independent music in the opening section; however, this divide steadily breaks down as we are led from the stormy and expressive opening through the ethereal central third. We are then led back to the material of the opening and into a climactic coda with grand echoes of the chamber music of Brahms. This then fades away, as the music runs itself out to silence.</p>

<h3 id="the-song-of-los-2019">The Song of Los (2019)</h3>
<p><em>for full orchestra - approx. 4 minutes</em></p>
<p><em>The Song of Los</em> is a poem for orchestra, inspired by and named after the William Blake poem of the same name. A slow meandering yet obsessive opening builds until it collapses into a broad chorale, carried in the trombones, which then builds throughout the orchestra. A momentary glimpse of the previous music is heard towards the end, before the chorale returns in a resounding victory.</p>
