  <h1>THE SONG of LOS</h1>
  <p><em>William Blake</em></p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>I will sing you a song of Los. the Eternal Prophet:<br>
He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity.<br>
In heart-formed Africa.<br>
Urizen faded! Ariston shudderd!<br>
And thus the Song began</p>
<p>Adam stood in the garden of Eden:<br>
And Noah on the mountains of Ararat;<br>
They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations<br>
By the hands of the children of Los.<br>
<br>
Adam shudderd! Noah faded! black grew the sunny African<br>
When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East:<br>
(Night spoke to the Cloud!<br>
Lo these Human form&rsquo;d spirits in smiling hipocrisy. War<br>
Against one another; so let them War on; slaves to the eternal Elements)<br>
Noah shrunk, beneath the waters;<br>
Abram fled in fires from Chaldea;<br>
Moses beheld upon Mount Sinai forms of dark delusion:<br>
<br>
To Trismegistus. Palamabron gave an abstract Law:<br>
To Pythagoras Socrates &amp; Plato.<br>
<br>
Times rolled on o&rsquo;er all the sons of Har, time after time<br>
Orc on Mount Atlas howld, chain&rsquo;d down with the Chain of Jealousy<br>
Then Oothoon hoverd over Judah &amp; Jerusalem<br>
And Jesus heard her voice (a man of sorrows) he recievd<br>
A Gospel from wretched Theotormon.<br>
<br>
The human race began to wither, for the healthy built<br>
Secluded places, fearing the joys of Love<br>
And the disease&rsquo;d only propagated:<br>
So Antamon call&rsquo;d up Leutha from her valleys of delight:<br>
And to Mahomet a loose Bible gave.<br>
But in the North, to Odin, Sotha gave a Code of War,<br>
Because of Diralada thinking to reclaim his joy.<br>
<br>
These were the Churches: Hospitals: Castles: Palaces:<br>
Like nets &amp; gins &amp; traps to catch the joys of Eternity And all the rest a desart;<br>
Till like a dream Eternity was obliterated &amp; erased.<br>
<br>
Since that dread day when Har and Heva fled.<br>
Because their brethren &amp; sisters liv&rsquo;d in War &amp; Lust;<br>
And as they fled they shrunk<br>
Into two narrow doleful forms:<br>
Creeping in reptile flesh upon<br>
The bosom of the ground:<br>
And all the vast of Nature shrunk<br>
Before their shrunken eyes.<br>
<br>
Thus the terrible race of Los &amp; Enitharmon gave<br>
Laws &amp; Religions to the sons of Har binding them more<br>
And more to Earth: closing and restraining:<br>
Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete<br>
Urizen wept &amp; gave it into the hands of Newton &amp; Locke<br>
<br>
Clouds roll heavy upon the Alps round Rousseau &amp; Voltaire:<br>
And on the mountains of Lebanon round the deceased Gods<br>
Of Asia; &amp; on the desarts of Africa round the Fallen Angels<br>
The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent<br>
<br>
ASIA             <br>
<br>
The Kings of Asia heard<br>
The howl rise up from Europe!<br>
And each ran out from his Web;<br>
From his ancient woven Den;<br>
For the darkness of Asia was startled<br>
At the thick-flaming, thought-creating fires of Orc.<br>
<br>
And the Kings of Asia stood<br>
And cried in bitterness of soul.<br>
<br>
Shall not the King call for Famine from the heath?<br>
Nor the Priest, for Pestilence from the fen?<br>
To restrain! to dismay! to thin!<br>
<br>
The inhabitants of mountain and plain;<br>
In the day, of full-feeding prosperity;<br>
And the night of delicious songs.<br>
<br>
Shall not the Councellor throw his curb<br>
Of Poverty on the laborious?<br>
To fix the price of labour;<br>
To invent allegoric riches:<br>
<br>
And the privy admonishers of men<br>
Call for fires in the City<br>
For heaps of smoking ruins,<br>
In the night of prosperity &amp; wantonness<br>
<br>
To turn man from his path,<br>
To restrain the child from the womb,<br>
To cut off the bread from the city,<br>
That the remnant may learn to obey.<br>
<br>
That the pride of the heart may fail;<br>
That the lust of the eyes may be quench&rsquo;d:<br>
That the delicate ear in its infancy<br>
May be dull&rsquo;d; and the nostrils clos&rsquo;d up;<br>
To teach mortal worms the path<br>
That leads from the gates of the Grave.<br>
<br>
Urizen heard them cry!<br>
And his shudd&rsquo;ring waving wings<br>
Went enormous above the red flames<br>
Drawing clouds of despair thro' the heavens<br>
Of Europe as he went:<br>
And his Books of brass iron &amp; gold<br>
Melted over the land as he flew,<br>
Heavy-waving, howling, weeping.<br>
<br>
And he stood over Judea:<br>
And stay&rsquo;d in his ancient place:<br>
And stretch&rsquo;d his clouds over Jerusalem;<br>
<br>
For Adam, a mouldering skeleton<br>
Lay bleach&rsquo;d on the garden of Eden;<br>
And Noah as white as snow<br>
On the mountains of Ararat.<br>
<br>
Then the thunders of Urizen bellow&rsquo;d aloud<br>
From his woven darkness above.<br>
<br>
Orc raging in European darkness<br>
Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps<br>
Like a serpent of fiery flame!<br>
The sullen Earth <br>
Shrunk!          <br>
<br>
Forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones<br>
Join: shaking convuls&rsquo;d the shivring clay breathes<br>
And all flesh naked stands: Fathers and Friends;<br>
Mothers &amp; Infants; Kings &amp; Warriors:<br>
<br>
The Grave shrieks with delight, &amp; shakes<br>
Her hollow womb, &amp; clasps the solid stem:<br>
Her bosom swells with wild desire:<br>
And milk &amp; blood &amp; glandous wine<br>
In rivers rush &amp; shout &amp; dance,<br>
On mountain, dale and plain.</p>
<p>The SONG of LOS is Ended. Urizen Wept.</p>
